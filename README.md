# Face-recognition-Attendance-System
Face Recognition Attendance System: Automate Your Attendance Tracking  This Python project empowers you to streamline and secure attendance management using facial recognition technology. It leverages powerful libraries like OpenCV to accurately identify individuals and record their presence in CSV format.


## Streamline attendance tracking with facial recognition!

This Python project leverages powerful libraries like `face_recognition` and `OpenCV` to detect and recognize faces for automated attendance marking.

**Features:**

- **Real-time face detection and recognition**
- **Attendance recording with timestamps in a CSV file**
- **Simple configuration with known student images**
- **Flexible student dataset management**

**Getting Started:**

1. **Install required libraries:**
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python face_recognition numpy csv
   ```
2. **Add student images:** Place images of known students in the `photos` folder.
3. **Run the script:**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
4. **View attendance records:** The attendance for each day is saved as a separate CSV file with the date as its name.

**Key Files:**

- `main.py`: Main Python script
- `photos/`: Store student images here

**Customization:**

- **Edit student names and image paths**
- **Adjust camera settings (if needed)**
